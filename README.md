# User Management App

This project demonstrates how to build a user management table using Next.js, TanStack Query, TanStack Table, and Shadcn UI components.

## Features:
- Global search and column-based filtering
- Sorting by column (e.g., Name, Email)
- Pagination for navigating large datasets

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the project locally:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Challenges:
- Implementing pagination with TanStack Table and synchronizing it with Next.js routing.
- Handling global and column filters in a simple yet effective way.
